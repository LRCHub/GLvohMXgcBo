> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Sometimes I feel like
I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like
my only friend
Is the city I live in
the city of angels
Lonely as I am
together we cry
I drive on her streets
cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills
cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds
and she kisses me windy
I never worry
now that is a lie
I don't ever want to
feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
take me all the way
I don't ever want to feel
like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
take me all the way
yeah yeah yeah
<♪>
It's hard to believe
that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe
that I'm all alone
At least I have her love
the city she loves me
Lonely as I am
together we cry
I don't ever want to
feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
take me all the way
I don't ever want to
feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
take me all the way
yeah yeah yeah
oh no no no yeah yeah
love me I say yeah yeah
under the bridge downtown
is where I drew some blood
under the bridge downtown
I could not get enough
under the bridge downtown
forgot about my love
under the bridge downtown
I gave my live away
yeah yeah yeah
<♪>
away here I stay
